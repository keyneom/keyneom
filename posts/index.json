    "body": "[Recently, a previous client reached out to me asking about how to avoid some recurring issues that their team was running into. In essence, members of the team continued to make silly but difficult to find errors that were taking much longer to fix than they should have taken. Often times, this is a symptom of a team&rsquo;s immature sense of urgency to hit deadlines, close out all the stories in a given sprint, or just keep the business happy. To be clear, a sense of urgency can be an important factor in developing a high-performing team but it can also be debilitating. As a result, I&rsquo;d like to provide some principles to keep in mind when facing these types of challenges. Integrals of Learning Many project managers are familiar with using not just a team&rsquo;s current position, but a team&rsquo;s velocity as a good measure of how a team is performing. It&rsquo;s true, velocity is powerful, but it is also an incomplete view of what lies ahead on the road to project success. Some of you might remember learning about derivatives during school. Below are a few classic graphs that help to visualize the relationship between: Position&ndash;where your team is on the path to your project milestones Velocity&ndash;how quickly a team is completing work Acceleration&ndash;the change in your team&rsquo;s velocity over time Acceleration and its underlying drivers are all too often left out of the equation to project success. The best driver I&rsquo;ve found to ensure ever-increasing velocity is to ensure continued effective learning! If your team has stopped learning, that is a recipe for negative acceleration! Now the question for project success becomes: How fast can you teach your team? But people never learn when they aren’t interested no matter how much you teach. So the question really becomes: How much can you inspire your team to learn? If you learn to inspire your team to continue learning and growing, then you will build a team that can deliver on the toughest deadlines while maintaining quality outputs. An immature sense of urgency ignores learning and as a result leads to failure and delays on all but the shortest timescales. Gut check: Is your team&rsquo;s velocity still increasing or has it gone flat? If your team&rsquo;s velocity has gone flat but you have a good team, you might be thinking there isn&rsquo;t much left for them to learn or that the 2-3 day training session you paid for didn&rsquo;t provide the benefits you were expecting. My company partners with you to actually get the job done all while sharing Tacit Knowledge and acting as an accelerant to your team&rsquo;s velocity. Learn. Coach. Give.]"

    "body": "[Is the glass half empty or half full? The most common responses to that question are summed up with the following labels and responses: The Pessimist - the glass is half empty The Optimist - the glass is half full The Realist - both half empty and half full I was in a meeting the other day and the above question was mentioned while discussing some of the teachings of Gordon B Hinckley, an avid optimist. While the discussion was rolling on I could imagine myself asking him the question and didn’t feel any of the answers above truly matched his outlook on life. In my mind I could see him, with a knowing twinkle in his eye, pulling something out from his over-sized suit coat and with a bit of a chuckle saying to me, “Mika, it is overflowing!” as he took the glass and poured it into his own much smaller one. All too often we allow others to set the context for our lives and in so doing concede to their “realism” a portion of our own happiness. Far from the passive answer of the optimist above, Gordon B. Hinckley would have encouraged you to actively engage in your optimism, otherwise you will always still have a glass that is half empty. A little later during that same meeting, someone else mentioned that it is our expectations that cause us to feel depressed about what happens around us and that by tapering those we might be able to enjoy a happier life. If you exert no effort, how can you be disappointed with what you get, right? And on first glance it might just seem like my imagined Gordon B. Hinckley was suggesting exactly that, but I’d be hesitant to jump onto that train, and at the very least, my imagined mentor is right there behind me telling me not to go just yet. That’s why I decided, setting expectations is hard. Until recently I probably would have told you that my approach was to expect perfection in the long run but to expect failure in the short term. That wasn’t exactly in line with my beliefs but I had felt it was close enough to get the point across. Now I’d say, “Expect perfection in the long term but understand failure in the short term.” This takes a bit more explanation, but in the end I think it is worth the distinction. Despite his optimism, Gordon B. Hinckley was absolutely rooted in realistic expectations. One of his favorite quotes was from Jenkins Lloyd Jones and went as follows: Anyone who imagines that bliss is normal is going to waste a lot of time running around shouting that he has been robbed. Most putts don’t drop. Most beef is tough. Most children grow up to be just people. Most successful marriages require a high degree of mutual toleration. Most jobs are more often dull than otherwise . . . The best goals and aspirations aren’t rooted in achievements as compared to others&ndash;and this goes for teams and organizations as much as for individuals&ndash;but should be about your own character and relationships. I.e. who you are becoming when all material things are stripped away. That’s why perfection in the long term is an okay goal to have in an infinite game. It shouldn’t be depressing when failures arise, because they weren’t what you were really shooting for anyways. They were just a bump in a long road to your final goal. If anything, let those failures light a fire under you to become even better. When you set the right goals, you can actively, optimistically, and realistically work towards them in a way that is liberatingly motivating. As a bonus for focusing on the right things, you’ll probably have a more enjoyable job, a fulfilling marriage and probably even a few good steaks in your life. Understanding failure means that we embrace it, learn from it, and leverage it to realize our long term goals. That is the active optimism Gordon B. Hinckley embodied for me and the one I continue to strive for in my own life. Even the realist cannot doubt when the active optimist reaches out, takes hold of the world, and fills their cup to overflowing.]"
