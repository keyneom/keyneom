  {"body":"Maslow\u0026rsquo;s Hiearchy Traditionally the Maslow Hierarchy is presented in the following form:\nWhile I think the multiple levels of the hierarchy are a good representation of many of the needs we as humans have. The concept of the hierarchy and the visualization of a pyramid can have a negative impact on our sense of fulfillment/self-actualization and on obtaining transcendence.\nWe have a rational understanding that there is no filling up, checking off, or completing the foundation for your physiological or safety needs. Our needs fluctuate minute by minute let alone throughout our lifetimes. Each of us as individuals has a unique combination of needs at higher or lower levels as compared to others.\nBut the way the hierarchy is presented does not account for this complexity. Instead it feels like we must have all of our physiological needs fulfilled in order to be able to begin addressing our needs for safety. This justifies a sort of stickiness to some of our favorite needs. We can\u0026rsquo;t spend the time addressing our need for aesthetic beauty until we have achieved stability. But true stability is never achieved. We must learn to live with our needs and not stick to them. The reality is that each need is a dimension upon which we can grow our sense of fulfillment.\nWhen we view our sense of self-actualization and transcendence as a multi-dimensional graph, we can see that it isn\u0026rsquo;t by maximizing a single need that we can achieve self-actualization. This is obvious in practice. No one ever works to ensure only one need is fulfilled.\nInstead we need to maximize the area of our multi-dimensional graph in order to give ourselves the best chance of achieving self-actualization. You\u0026rsquo;ll note that this is a relative scale. The hard outer line forming the hexagon is dependent on our unique personality and character. The soft green inner area is dependent on how well our needs are being fulfilled.\nIf the graph were absolute instead of relative to us as individuals it might look like this:\nHow well are you maximizing your multi-dimensional graph? Have you been spending too much time trying to establish financial stability or been overly focused on achievement and status? Push out across some other dimensions and you may find it enhances your happiness in life. In the past, mountain men had lower tolerances for physiological, safety, and perhaps belonging needs, but likely with a stronger need for esteem. Some kids even from a very early age will get caught up working through a puzzle rather than wanting to eat. As the human race, our historical tolerance for our physiological and/or safety needs not being met is surprisingly high across history. Few people had strong assurances that they\u0026rsquo;d survive the coming winter; despite this fact, they would sing, dance, invent games, and spend time studying the universe. Altruistic behavior when people are in circumstances that obviously are not meeting all their needs re-emphasizes this fact. Coming to terms with the unique balance of needs met that optimizes your happiness will play an important role in your self-actualization. You don\u0026rsquo;t need to wait before you can start maximizing the area on your graph. Have a beautiful life!\n","title":"Maslow Is Misleading You","url":"/posts/maslow-is-misleading-you/"}
  
  , {"body":"TL;DR Taking offense is always the wrong choice . . . and it is a choice! But don\u0026rsquo;t easily offend either.\nTypes of Offense The reality is that there are primarily a couple different situations to consider in which offense is taken:\n Someone wants to offend others Someone wants to improve the life of others  Commonly, the second scenario occurs when someone is making a poor joke or someone wants to help you and doesn\u0026rsquo;t know how to do so in a manner you find acceptable.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll note that in the situations above, nowhere do I mention who is in the right or who is in the wrong. Offense has nothing to do with right or wrong and it should be treated independent of it. It is a reactive\u0026ndash;instead of proactive\u0026ndash;approach to life. To say that someone offended you is to cede your self-control and hand them the reigns. Do not give anyone that power over you!\nTeam Dynamics A team working together that is prone to taking offense is a team that will stagnate and rot. A willingness from all parties to avoid taking offense acts as a lubricant to overcome the friction inherit to working together and enables teams to work quickly and smoothly. A fear of offending someone is a freezing agent reducing communication and inhibiting learning opportunities from being fully leveraged.\nTo be clear, not taking offense doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that you can\u0026rsquo;t speak up or mention anything that feels wrong to you. On the contrary, a truly offense-free environment should help to facilitate making those kinds of statements. If someone says something that could be taken to be offensive, assume good intentions and let them know without anger or frustration. If you need some time to overcome your initial emotions. Take that time. Come back when you are ready to have that conversation and do so in a one-on-one setting. In this setting, it will be easier to determine what the intent of the interaction was and whether (1) there are changes you could make, (2) there are changes they could make, or (3) if it\u0026rsquo;s best to avoid continued interactions with this person as much as possible\u0026ndash;obviously the least desirable outcome.\nIt is a sign of professional maturity to keep your calm even when confronted with potentially offensive scenarios and allow them to flow past you as you move forward in life.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t Easily Offend Since you are focused on a proactive and not a reactive state of mind another important point to be made is that you should take reasonable steps to avoid offending others. If people are consistently feeling offended by your behavior then you are likely making a mistake. The assumption here is that you have good intentions and aren\u0026rsquo;t intending to offend. Perhaps take some time to think through your message or get advice from someone else on how you might be able to frame your thoughts in a way so others are more receptive. After all, your intentions are good, if they reject your message as a result of its presentation you\u0026rsquo;ve failed.\nLastly, I\u0026rsquo;d like to discuss a bit of the other scenario. The scenario we\u0026rsquo;d likely rather not admit happens with us. The scenario in which we find ourselves trying to offend someone else. Surprisingly, this can be a difficult situation to even recognize at times. Passive-aggressive statements that could have been left unsaid are common. It\u0026rsquo;s important to recognize the root cause of this type of behavior. In my experience there are usually multiple things that rub us the wrong way about a person that drives us towards these types of interactions\u0026ndash;perhaps just that they tend to be offensive to others themself. In these scenarios it\u0026rsquo;s best to reflect on what may be bothering us and take a proactive approach to getting the issues resolved. It may just require getting to know the other person better or in another setting.\nConclusion We as human beings are here on Earth to act\u0026ndash;not just be acted upon. When we choose to allow others to offend us we are weakening who and what we are and instead giving others an easily-abused power over us. Instead we ought to take the approach of the active optimist by (1) assuming good intentions, (2) avoiding passive-aggressive ax-grinding by confronting real issues in a way that has a real chance of leading to change, and (3) being humble enough to change our delivery so our message can actually be received.\n","title":"Never Take Offense","url":"/posts/never-take-offense/"}
  
  , {"body":"Recently, a previous client reached out to me asking about how to avoid some recurring issues that their team was running into. In essence, members of the team continued to make silly but difficult to find errors that were taking much longer to fix than they should have taken. Often times, this is a symptom of a team\u0026rsquo;s immature sense of urgency to hit deadlines, close out all the stories in a given sprint, or just keep the business happy. To be clear, a sense of urgency can be an important factor in developing a high-performing team but it can also be debilitating. As a result, I\u0026rsquo;d like to provide some principles to keep in mind when facing these types of challenges.\nIntegrals of Learning Many project managers are familiar with using not just a team\u0026rsquo;s current position, but a team\u0026rsquo;s velocity as a good measure of how a team is performing. It\u0026rsquo;s true, velocity is powerful, but it is also an incomplete view of what lies ahead on the road to project success. Some of you might remember learning about derivatives during school. Below are a few classic graphs that help to visualize the relationship between:\n Position\u0026ndash;where your team is on the path to your project milestones Velocity\u0026ndash;how quickly a team is completing work Acceleration\u0026ndash;the change in your team\u0026rsquo;s velocity over time  Acceleration and its underlying drivers are all too often left out of the equation to project success. The best driver I\u0026rsquo;ve found to ensure ever-increasing velocity is to ensure continued effective learning! If your team has stopped learning, that is a recipe for negative acceleration!\nNow the question for project success becomes:\nHow fast can you teach your team?\nBut people never learn when they aren’t interested no matter how much you teach. So the question really becomes:\nHow much can you inspire your team to learn?\nIf you learn to inspire your team to continue learning and growing, then you will build a team that can deliver on the toughest deadlines while maintaining quality outputs. An immature sense of urgency ignores learning and as a result leads to failure and delays on all but the shortest timescales.\nGut check: Is your team\u0026rsquo;s velocity still increasing or has it gone flat?\nIf your team\u0026rsquo;s velocity has gone flat but you have a good team, you might be thinking there isn\u0026rsquo;t much left for them to learn or that the 2-3 day training session you paid for didn\u0026rsquo;t provide the benefits you were expecting. My company partners with you to actually get the job done all while sharing Tacit Knowledge and acting as an accelerant to your team\u0026rsquo;s velocity.\nLearn. Coach.

  , {"body":"Overcoming Trials in a World of Instant Gratification Today during my talk I\u0026rsquo;d like to focus on how and why we need to develop the Christlike attribute of resilience and grit. To me, they are the same thing in practice so you\u0026rsquo;ll hear me use them interchangeably throughout the talk.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s start with the why. In September\u0026rsquo;s Ensign there is a talk by Elder Lynn G. Robbins on Resilience. In that talk he shares a story:\n The story is told that during British rule of colonial India, an unacceptable number of venomous cobras lived in and around Delhi. To solve the problem, local authorities began paying a bounty for dead cobras. The ill-advised bounty backfired when enterprising locals began breeding cobras for profit. When the bounty ended, the breeders set the cobras free, further compounding the problem.\nThe phenomenon of unintended side effects sometimes causing more harm than intended benefits is known as the \u0026ldquo;cobra effect.\u0026rdquo;\n Elder Robbins goes on to describe how in college, in the mission field, and even in the military many younger members of each group are failing to make it through the respective programs and returning instead to live with their parents. He says:\n Universities, the military, and the mission field aren\u0026rsquo;t causing the problem; they are simply revealing it. Lower resilience among today\u0026rsquo;s youth may actually be an unintended consequence\u0026ndash;a modern-day cobra effect.\n In an overprotective society of instant gratification and fewer and fewer consequences, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to see how we might be weakening our sense of resilience and grit. The changes occurring in society are introducing unintended consequences on the character of our youth and on ourselves. When we do finally run into responsibility and trials, we can be ill-prepared to confront them and overcome them with faith. So how can we build up the virtue of Resilience?\nPer Harvard:\n Research has identified a common set of factors that predispose children to positive outcomes in the face of significant adversity. Individuals who demonstrate resilience in response to one form of adversity may not necessarily do so in response to another. Yet when these positive influences are operating effectively, they \u0026ldquo;stack the scale\u0026rdquo; with positive weight and optimize resilience across multiple contexts. These counterbalancing factors include\n  facilitating supportive adult-child relationships; building a sense of self-efficacy and perceived control; providing opportunities to strengthen adaptive skills and self-regulatory capacities; and mobilizing sources of faith, hope, and cultural traditions.   The single most common factor for children who develop resilience is at least one stable and committed relationship with a supportive parent, caregiver, or other adult.\n In other words, the unconditional love of a parent is critical! But it is not enough on its own! Elder Robbins indicates four gospel principles that he believes are key to fomenting our growth:\n Self-reliance, Opposition in all things, The Gift of the Holy Ghost, and Moral Agency   Learning to cope with manageable threats is critical for the development of resilience. Not all stress is harmful. There are numerous opportunities in every child\u0026rsquo;s life to experience manageable stress—and with the help of supportive adults, this \u0026ldquo;positive stress\u0026rdquo; can be growth-promoting. Over time, we become better able to cope with life\u0026rsquo;s obstacles and hardships, both physically and mentally.\n An environment in which we can experience hardships but that will not tempt us beyond that which we are able is as necessary for our children as it has been and continues to be for ourselves. This opposition in all things enables our children to experience confidence and joy. A family I knew growing up said \u0026ldquo;I can do hard things.\u0026rdquo; Without difficulties, we \u0026ldquo;must needs remain as dead, having no life neither death, nor corruption nor incorruption, happiness nor misery, neither sense nor insensibility.\u0026rdquo; I like that scripture, and not just because I feel like an ancient prophet is telling us to get a life, but because it speaks to what people are experiencing in today\u0026rsquo;s world. I have people I work with that have no idea whether the way they are living their lives is right or wrong, and are missing joy and meaning as a result.\nWe must become agents unto ourselves and things to act and not just be acted upon. If we shield our children from accountability and consequences, if we shield them from decision making and independent thought, they will become dependent on us, yes, but they will also come to resent us. We are keeping them from their purpose here on Earth, and we are preventing them from ever experiencing true joy. In 2 Nephi 2:16 it states, \u0026ldquo;Wherefore, the Lord God gave unto man that he should act for himself. Wherefore, man could not act for himself save it should be that he was enticed by the one or the other.\u0026rdquo;\nBut agency doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean indifferently allowing our children to do whatever they want, we still have a need to persuade them of what is right. Perhaps even more importantly, agency needs to be coupled with accountability to be of any worth. We cannot allow others to act indiscriminately and then eliminate every ramification of their actions without expecting to court disaster.\nSo what type of parent should we be? It may still feel unclear to some. Should we be strict, demanding and maintain high standards? Or should we be a supportive parent, warm and respectful of their personalities?\n It used to be thought that you . . . had to pick somewhere on the continuum. It actually turns out that there isn\u0026rsquo;t a tradeoff. You can be extremely supportive, warm, tell them that you love them unconditionally, and, at the same time, be a very firm, high standards disciplinarian. There is not one continuum; there are two.\n Per Angela Duckworth, a well known researcher on grit,\n This combination of being very warm and very demanding is called authoritative parenting. We don\u0026rsquo;t yet have the research linking authoritative parenting to character itself, but from everything we do know, the parents who are not only modeling character for their kids, but bringing up their kids in a supportive, warm, consistently disciplined, high expectations environment, are helping their kids stand the best chance of developing character as they get older.\n Again, \u0026ldquo;the parents who are . . . modeling character.\u0026rdquo; We need to be an example of these characteristics if we expect our children to develop them or make the choice to adopt them. It is never too late to build resilience. Our Father in Heaven and Older Brother are there, full of unconditional love and ready to support us if we will but choose to exercise our agency and follow them.\n Teaching children how to face, work through, and conquer their trials helps them think for themselves, reason through problems, and recognize and understand the whisperings of the Holy Ghost. Only through their own experience in solving problems do they develop common sense and wisdom and grow in their ability to \u0026ldquo;study it out\u0026rdquo; and receive revelation.\nThere is risk in honoring the agency of our children and leaving them at the fork in the road. Because the doctrine of agency was indispensable to the plan of salvation, our Father in Heaven took that same risk in the premortal life.\nIf I could amend slightly a quote by the Prophet Joseph Smith, I would state it this way regarding children: \u0026ldquo;We teach them correct principles because whether we like it or not, they will govern themselves.\u0026rdquo; The day will come when our children will leave home. Our only hope as parents is to teach them correct principles about the plan of salvation and help them recognize the whisperings of the Spirit to guide them in the wise use of their agency. Otherwise, they may lack the spiritual self-reliance and resilience to face future trials, with a chance that we could lose them.\n Ultimate Concern Quoting again from Angela Duckworth regarding her definition of Grit:\n Grit is passion and perseverance for long-term goals. One way to think about grit is to consider what grit isn\u0026rsquo;t. Grit isn\u0026rsquo;t talent. Grit isn\u0026rsquo;t luck. Grit isn\u0026rsquo;t how intensely, for the moment, you want something.\nInstead, grit is about having what some researchers call an \u0026ldquo;ultimate concern\u0026rdquo;–a goal you care about so much that it organizes and gives meaning to almost everything you do. And grit is holding steadfast to that goal. Even when you fall down. Even when you screw up. Even when progress toward that goal is halting or slow.\nTalent and luck matter to success. But talent and luck are no guarantee of grit. And in the very long run, I think grit may matter at least as much, if not more.\n I\u0026rsquo;d like to reiterate something she said:\n Grit is about having what some researchers call an\u0026quot;ultimate concern\u0026quot;–a goal you care about so much that it organizes and gives meaning to almost everything you do.\n An Ultimate Concern??!!? This is about as close as academics is willing to get to saying you should be seeking eternal life! As we ensure that our children are not just taking a checkbox approach to living the gospel and doing exactly what we\u0026rsquo;ve asked them to but instead truly enable them to act for themselves and support them and encourage them to live the principles of the gospel in accordance with the dictates of their own conscience, we can give them the best chance of success not just in this life but in preparing for the life to come. Helping them to gain the ultimate concern as a goal in their own lives will provide them with stability and meaning and power to overcome the trials of this life.\nQuoting President Hinckley:\n There is no end in sight for the good you can do. Do you know it? You are just simple kids. You are not geniuses. I know that. But the work of the world isn\u0026rsquo;t done by geniuses. It is done by ordinary people who have learned to work in an extraordinary way people of your kind who can do these things.\n As my father says, \u0026ldquo;work answereth all things\u0026rdquo;.\nThe Savior and the Atonement The Savior is the perfect example of true grit.\nIn speaking about the atonement he states:\n Which suffering caused myself, even God, the greatest of all, to tremble because of pain, and to bleed at every pore, and to suffer both body and spirit—and would that I might not drink the bitter cup, and shrink—\nNevertheless, glory be to the Father, and I partook and finished my preparations unto the children of men.\n Nevertheless he pushed through, descending below all things so that we might have the opportunity of Eternal Life. This was His ultimate concern. Thanks to His grit we can utilize the atonement, not just to receive forgiveness for our sins but to strengthen ourselves in times of weakness and trials, to develop the grit necessary in our own lives to move forward helping others on our way to Eternal Life.\nI bear my testimony of the truth of these principles, that as we re-frame our lives in optimism, in action, in gaining beneficial experiences despite the difficulties they bring, and choose to focus our lives on the proper ultimate concern, that our faith in the Savior and in His atonement will be perfected. It will become strong and unshakeable. It will act as a light in the darkness to those around us and an example by which our children can steer their lives. The world is starving for this knowledge. We are starving for this knowledge, and while they beat around it in search of it, they know not where to find it. I pray that I might do a better job of ingesting it full-heartedly and that in so doing, some others along my way might be inspired enough to ignore the jeering from the great and spacious building and partake of God\u0026rsquo;s love.\nI pray for you all, that you might find happiness and peace and love in this life. I pray for you that God will guide your path and the path of your families. I pray that we\u0026rsquo;ll be able to unite as one as a ward, that we might forgive one another, and that we might be willing to extend just ever so much more than we already do to grasp the hand of our Brothers and Sisters in need and pull them into the fold and into safety. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\n Pessimism, Realism, and Optimism Are you a glass half-full, half-empty, or both empty and full type of person? If you find yourself leaning towards anything other than optimism, I hope, by the end of my talk, you\u0026rsquo;ll feel inspired to repent and choose a more positive path forward in life. I know that if you do, you will be blessed as a result and find greater joy, as I have, in this approach to life. Now, for those of you thinking you are an optimist already, and that you\u0026rsquo;re all set, hold on for a sec, because optimism, in and of itself, is not enough.\nMany years ago, I used to consider myself a realist, but over time I found, first amongst others and later within myself, that this approach to life was really just a veiled form of pessimism. Although it\u0026rsquo;s true that the cup is half full and half empty, we are really choosing to focus solely on what is in front of us and choosing to ignore our capacity to act. As an example, I\u0026rsquo;m a consultant. At work I manage technical projects, and oftentimes some parts of the project are moving along just fine but other parts of the project are struggling and running into issues. I can choose to focus on the portions that are failing and lose my motivation to complete any of the other parts as well. I can say I\u0026rsquo;m a realist and recognize that things are a combination of good and bad. But in reality, this changes nothing. Recognizing good and bad is not enough. The real reality is that I have the power to influence the eventual outcome of the project, and only when I take an optimistic approach to what I am able to do to improve the project am I able to improve the situation. An actively pessimistic view will obviously move things in a negative direction. But importantly, taking the realist\u0026rsquo;s stance never includes action, at best it remains neutral. Being a passive optimist is also never enough. This is when we turn a blind eye to what is wrong and pretend everything is fine. The best approach is that of an active optimist. The active optimist realizes the project isn\u0026rsquo;t in perfect shape, but also is actively looking for opportunities to improve it and get things back on track. The active optimist when confronted with the question \u0026ldquo;Is the cup half-empty, or half-full?\u0026rdquo; knowingly takes the cup and fills it to overflowing.\n Appendix  https://www.waltonfamilyfoundation.org/stories/k-12-education/a-q-a-with-character-labs-dr-angela-duckworth  Strict or supportive, which should we choose? it used to be thought that you could be a supportive parent — super warm and respecting your child\u0026rsquo;s individuality — or you could be a demanding, strict, high standards parent. And you had to pick somewhere on the continuum. It actually turns out that there isn\u0026rsquo;t a tradeoff. You can be extremely supportive, warm, tell them that you love them unconditionally, and, at the same time, be a very firm, high standards disciplinarian. There is not one continuum; there are two. This combination of being very warm and very demanding is called authoritative parenting. We don\u0026rsquo;t yet have the research linking authoritative parenting to character itself, but from everything we do know, the parents who are not only modeling character for their kids, but bringing up their kids in a supportive, warm, consistently disciplined, high expectations environment, are helping their kids stand the best chance of developing character as they get older. Both! They are not mutually exclusive.   Difference between self-control and grit: https://upenn.app.box.com/s/67xypfb2zqtuacd1jrbh  Other than talent and opportunity, what makes some people more successful than others? One important determinant of success is self-control—the capacity to regulate attention, emotion, and behavior in the presence of temptation. A second important determinant of success is grit—the tenacious pursuit of a dominant superordinate goal despite setbacks. Self-control and grit are strongly correlated, but not perfectly so. This means that some people with high levels of self-control capably handle temptations but do not consistently pursue a dominant goal. Likewise, some exceptional achievers are prodigiously gritty but succumb to temptations in domains other than their chosen life passion. Understanding how goals are hierarchically organized clarifies how self-control and grit are related but distinct: Self-control entails aligning actions with any valued goal despite momentarily more-alluring alternatives; grit, in contrast, entails having and working assiduously toward a single challenging superordinate goal through thick and thin, on a timescale of years or even decades. Although both self-control and grit entail aligning actions with intentions, they operate in different ways and over different timescales. This hierarchical goal framework suggests novel directions for basic and applied research on success.   https://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/transcripts/devotionals/2002_10_22_hinckley.htm?cid=AR17_09-02-2018_BYUPW_InaugurationFeature_10  There is no end in sight for the good you can do.

The brain and other biological systems are most adaptable early in life. Yet while their development lays the foundation for a wide range of resilient behaviors, it is never too late to build resilience. Age-appropriate, health-promoting activities can significantly improve the odds that an individual will recover from stress-inducing experiences. For example, regular physical exercise, stress-reduction practices, and programs that actively build executive function and self-regulation skills can improve the abilities of children and adults to cope with, adapt to, and even prevent adversity in their lives. Adults who strengthen these skills in themselves can better model healthy behaviors for their children, thereby improving the resilience of the next generation.   https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/2019/09/building-resilience-eight-tips-for-parents?lang=eng  Model good coping skills.

  , {"body":"Is the glass half empty or half full?\nThe most common responses to that question are summed up with the following labels and responses:\n The Pessimist - the glass is half empty The Optimist - the glass is half full The Realist - both half empty and half full  I was in a meeting the other day and the above question was mentioned while discussing some of the teachings of Gordon B Hinckley, an avid optimist. While the discussion was rolling on I could imagine myself asking him the question and didn’t feel any of the answers above truly matched his outlook on life. In my mind I could see him, with a knowing twinkle in his eye, pulling something out from his over-sized suit coat and with a bit of a chuckle saying to me, “Mika, it is overflowing!” as he took the glass and poured it into his own much smaller one.\nAll too often we allow others to set the context for our lives and in so doing concede to their “realism” a portion of our own happiness. Far from the passive answer of the optimist above, Gordon B. Hinckley would have encouraged you to actively engage in your optimism, otherwise you will always still have a glass that is half empty.\nA little later during that same meeting, someone else mentioned that it is our expectations that cause us to feel depressed about what happens around us and that by tapering those we might be able to enjoy a happier life. If you exert no effort, how can you be disappointed with what you get, right? And on first glance it might just seem like my imagined Gordon B. Hinckley was suggesting exactly that, but I’d be hesitant to jump onto that train, and at the very least, my imagined mentor is right there behind me telling me not to go just yet.\nThat’s why I decided, setting expectations is hard. Until recently I probably would have told you that my approach was to expect perfection in the long run but to expect failure in the short term. That wasn’t exactly in line with my beliefs but I had felt it was close enough to get the point across. Now I’d say, “Expect perfection in the long term but understand failure in the short term.” This takes a bit more explanation, but in the end I think it is worth the distinction.\nDespite his optimism, Gordon B. Hinckley was absolutely rooted in realistic expectations. One of his favorite quotes was from Jenkins Lloyd Jones and went as follows:\n Anyone who imagines that bliss is normal is going to waste a lot of time running around shouting that he has been robbed. Most putts don’t drop. Most beef is tough. Most children grow up to be just people. Most successful marriages require a high degree of mutual toleration. Most jobs are more often dull than otherwise . . .\n The best goals and aspirations aren’t rooted in achievements as compared to others\u0026ndash;and this goes for teams and organizations as much as for individuals\u0026ndash;but should be about your own character and relationships. I.e. who you are becoming when all material things are stripped away. That’s why perfection in the long term is an okay goal to have in an infinite game. It shouldn’t be depressing when failures arise, because they weren’t what you were really shooting for anyways. They were just a bump in a long road to your final goal. If anything, let those failures light a fire under you to become even better.\nWhen you set the right goals, you can actively, optimistically, and realistically work towards them in a way that is liberatingly motivating. As a bonus for focusing on the right things, you’ll probably have a more enjoyable job, a fulfilling marriage and probably even a few good steaks in your life.\nUnderstanding failure means that we embrace it, learn from it, and leverage it to realize our long term goals. That is the active optimism Gordon B. Hinckley embodied for me and the one I continue to strive for in my own life. Even the realist cannot doubt when the active optimist reaches out, takes hold of the world, and fills their cup to overflowing.\n","title":"Optimism and Expectations","url":"/posts/optimism-and-expectations/"}
